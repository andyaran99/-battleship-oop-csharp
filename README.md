# Battleship OOP Csharp

## Premise

For this project i had to implement a game of battleship. Battleship (also known as Battleships or Sea Battle) is a strategy type guessing game for two players. It is played on ruled grids (paper or board) on which each player's fleet of warships are marked. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player. Players alternate turns calling "shots" at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.



## What I learned during this project

-UML diagrams

-Clean code

-Encapsulation

-Abstraction

-Polymorphism

-Inheritance

-Enums

-S and O principles from SOLID

-Namespaces in C#

-Properties and get-only properties in C#



## The implementation process of the game

- Gaining good understanding of the OOP principles and implement them in your code.
- Implementing the Battleship class. This is used as the highest level class.
- Implementing the Display class and its methods.
- Implementing the Input class and its methods.
- Implementing the Game class and its methods.
- Implementing the Player class and its methods.
- Implementing the BoardFactory class and its methods.
- Implementing the Board class and its methods.
- Implementing the Ship class and its methods.
- Implementing the ShipType enum and its methods.
- Implementing the Square class and its methods.
- Implementing the SquareStatus enum.


## How to Play
1. Clone the repository localy from the github
2. Run the game 
3. Choose the board length
4. The game will ask the players to pick the numbers of ships
5. The game will ask a valid skyp type and starting position and the direction of each ship
6. After each player have placed the ships they will begin to shoot on each other board
7. The game will end when a player doesnt have any ships left
